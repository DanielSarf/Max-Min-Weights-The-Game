# Min-Max Weights: The Game

## Introduction

Welcome to **Max Min Weights: The Game**, a fun and educational 2D game designed to teach players the Min-Max Weights algorithm. Created by Daniel Sarfraz & Kiran Fatima for their 5th Semester "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course, this game challenges you to identify the heaviest and lightest cubes using a two-pan balance with a limited number of weighings.
It is made from scratch using HTML, CSS and JS.

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Identify the heaviest and lightest cube.
2. **Weighing**: Use the two-pan balance to compare the weights of the cubes.
3. **Limit**: You have a limited number of weighings to achieve your goal.
4. **Guess Early**: You can guess the heaviest and lightest cubes before using all weighings.
